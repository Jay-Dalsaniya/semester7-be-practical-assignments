Disable SSL Verification Temporarily:
As a temporary measure (not recommended for long-term use), you can disable SSL verification:
bash
Copy code
git config --global http.sslVerify false
This will bypass the SSL certificate verification. Ensure to enable it again after testing:
bash
Copy code
git config --global http.sslVerify true
